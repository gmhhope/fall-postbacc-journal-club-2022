# A proposed Journal club for postbacc in 2022
- This is a proposed prototype for Journal club in 2022 Fall
- To enhance interaction between JC leader and postbacc students, I create this github repo mainly for three fold of reasons
  - this site can serve as resources repository and JC leader can keep the information update for each class
    - Mind maps (I create webpage for it to show in Github page too)
    - Reflection sheet
    - Presentations
    - Assignment for presentation
    - Papers
  - Github issue provides an interface for students and JC leaders to communicate immediately. Instead of using emails to have one-to-one conversion, Github Issue can involve all members for discussion of the same topics.

## mind map github page
Github provides excellent way to share html format of created mind maps (using ithoughtX) in the cloud. 
- How to access the github page?
  - `https://gmhhope.github.io/fall-postbacc-journal-club-2022/mindmap/` + `folder_path_under_mindmap`
  - for example, https://gmhhope.github.io/fall-postbacc-journal-club-2022/mindmap/JC_1/Reflection-sheet-explained/index.html

## github issue
- Github issue provides an excellent platform for students to generate question and seek discussions. JC leader will keep track with those questions along with the reflection sheet.
- Once the questions are posted. JC leaders and postbacc trainees can reply to the questions. If the questions are solved, then the issue can be closed.
- This will be a very nice format to go through the Q&A session before the class. And during the class, instead of looking through individual word document, the Q&A session will also have a solid ground to run on by tracing back to the issues..

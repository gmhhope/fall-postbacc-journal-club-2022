# Acute coronavirus disease and Long-COVID

SARS-CoV-2 has been with us for more than two years and we are entering the post-COVID-19 era now. Reports have been accumulated to better understand the disease and we got the vaccines and some anti-viral drugs. However, we need to learn from the pandemics and prepare for the “known unknowns” – the new plagues destined to come. Furthermore, given the fact that millions of people were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, the chronic post-COVID conditions (or Long COVID) are becoming ever more concerning and require immediate attentions. In this journal club, we will review the major milestones in the key COVID research areas and scrutinize the cutting-edge research papers.

In the first half of the journal club, we are going to learn about the innate and adaptive immunity triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, understand how vaccine technology tailor our immunity against the disease and explore how system vaccinology learn from the pandemic and transform strategies toward personalized vaccines in the future. In the second half, we will have a deep dive into various consequences caused by the massive inflammation after COVID infection in subset of patients, including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Long COVID. We will discuss the recent hypotheses of the causes of Long COVID and summarize the prospects of research related to Long COVID and in broader sense, to the convoluted chronic fatigue syndromes (ME/CFS).

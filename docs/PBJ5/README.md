## PBJ5: mRNA vaccines, adjuvanticity and Systems vaccinology
Up to now, we should have solid understanding of COVID-19-related immune response, and we will take a systematic view of how mRNA vaccine elicits protective innate and adaptive immune responses. And discuss how we can learn from the vaccine to design a better one in the future (we will also touch on mucosal vaccine development).

## PBJ9: Multiple early factors anticipate post-acute COVID-19 sequelae (Long COVID)
With some curious examples of post-COVID-19 sequalae, we will take a broader scope to a larger population suffering from Long COVID, of which the diagnosis and etiology remains largely unknown. We will scrutinize at the current hypotheses and how scientists try to demystify the disease.

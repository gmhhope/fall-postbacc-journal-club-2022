### Long COVID, ‘viral ghosts’ and gastrointestinal symptoms?
Long COVID, ‘viral ghosts’ and gastrointestinal symptoms?43–47
Gastrointestinal symptom is also an COVID-19-specific unusual feature caused by a respiratory virus. More importantly, it shows that GI can become viral reservoirs for persistent COVID symptoms. Interestingly, GI symptoms have also been associated with chronic fatigue syndrome. Are mucosal immunology and gut microbiome critical in this regard?

### Long COVID and autoimmunity?
Long COVID also associates with autoantibodies generation that leads to immunopathology. And various mechanisms have been proposed and we can take a deeper look into it.

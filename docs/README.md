# Acute coronavirus disease and Long-COVID

SARS-CoV-2 has been with us for more than two years and we are entering the post-COVID-19 era now. Reports have been accumulated to better understand the disease and we got the vaccines and some anti-viral drugs. However, we need to learn from the pandemics and prepare for the “known unknowns” – the new plagues destined to come. Furthermore, given the fact that millions of people were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 acute infection, the chronic post-COVID conditions (or Long COVID) are becoming ever more concerning and require immediate attentions. In this journal club, we will review the major milestones in the key COVID research areas and scrutinize the cutting-edge research papers.

In the first half of the journal club, we are going to learn about the innate and adaptive immunity triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, understand how vaccine technology tailor our immunity against the disease and explore how system vaccinology learn from the pandemic and transform strategies toward personalized vaccines in the future. In the second half, we will have a deep dive into various consequences caused by the massive inflammation after COVID infection in subset of patients, including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Long COVID. We will discuss the recent hypotheses of the causes of Long COVID and summarize the prospects of research related to Long COVID and in broader sense, to the convoluted chronic fatigue syndromes (ME/CFS).

1. The immune system and COVID-19: Friend or foe?
This sets the tone for the journal club and provoke students to discuss the “Yin-Yang” of the immune
responses stimulated by SARS2-CoV2. I will take more initiatives to discuss this with emphasis on the innate immune parts (monocytes and neutrophils), which prelude for the next section.
2. Infected innate immune cells hint at cause of severe COVID
The most recent research indicates that SARS2-CoV2 infect lung-macrophages and elicit
inflammasome activation that leads to aggressive proinflammatory responses. A perfect example of adversary effect of dysregulated immune responses.
3. Evolution of antibody immunity to SARS-CoV-2
Then we switch to the good part of immunity – antibody responses by B cells. We will mainly discuss how B cell maturation facilitate spike-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and touch on the evolution of SAS-CoV-2 variants and how Omicron escapes antibody surveillance.
4. Cross reactive T cells hold up against Omicron
Then we transition to T cell responses, which recently shows to be important to fight against Omicron, even though it escapes from antibody responses.
5. mRNA vaccines, adjuvanticity and Systems vaccinology
Up to now, we should have solid understanding of COVID-19-related immune response, and we will take a systematic view of how mRNA vaccine elicits protective innate and adaptive immune responses. And discuss how we can learn from the vaccine to design a better one in the future (we will also touch on mucosal vaccine development).
6. COVID, smell loss and neurological manifestation?
Reaching the second half, we switch to post-COVID-19 era focusing on the sequalae due to COVID- 19 infection. One of the idiosyncratic symptoms is the smell loss. Some very recent research indicates that it also alludes to brain pathology.
 
7. COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome?
Another scary story is that COVID-19 infection may raise risks to develop type-II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Is immunology involved?
8. Children, COVID-19, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome
Children, though usually have less severe disease if contract COVID-19, may result in multi-organ hyperinflammatory symptoms. Given that they may be ineligible for vaccination, this becomes an immediate concern.
9. Multiple early factors anticipate post-acute COVID-19 sequelae (Long COVID)
With some curious examples of post-COVID-19 sequalae, we will take a broader scope to a larger population suffering from Long COVID, of which the diagnosis and etiology remains largely unknown. We will scrutinize at the current hypotheses and how scientists try to demystify the disease.
10. Long COVID, ‘viral ghosts’ and gastrointestinal symptoms?
Gastrointestinal symptom is also an COVID-19-specific unusual feature caused by a respiratory virus. More importantly, it shows that GI can become viral reservoirs for persistent COVID symptoms. Interestingly, GI symptoms have also been associated with chronic fatigue syndrome. Are mucosal immunology and gut microbiome critical in this regard?
11. Long COVID and autoimmunity?
Long COVID also associates with autoantibodies generation that leads to immunopathology. And various mechanisms have been proposed and we can take a deeper look into it.
